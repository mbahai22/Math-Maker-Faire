    <h3>What Is It?</h3>
    <img align="right" src="https://media1.giphy.com/media/5ahqosQDRDAGc/source.gif" alt="mandelbrot set" height="188" width="250" hspace="10px">
    <p>According to the <a href="https://fractalfoundation.org/resources/what-are-fractals/" target="_blank">Fractal Foundation</a>, a fractal is "an infinitely complex pattern that is self-similar across different scales," or in other words a shape that constantly repeats in shape and structure when zoomed in on. These phenomena are found all over the natural world but more complex fractals can be found in the mathematical world. For example, one fractal is the Mandelbrot set (right).

    <h3 align="center">Who is Mandelbrot?</h3>
    <img align="left" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Mandelbrot_p1130861.jpg/320px-Mandelbrot_p1130861.jpg" alt="the Benoit boy" height="188" width="250" hspace="10px">
    <p>Benoit Mandelbrot was a French, Polish, and American mathematician who was born on November 20, 1984, to a family of immigrants from Warsaw, who later moved to France. At a young age, Mandelbrot studied mathematics in school and he grew up to work at IBM and act as a professor at Harvard. He later revolutionized the field of fractal geometry both in the mathematical sense as well as in the natural world, as he pointed out how many of the many phenomena of the world like clouds and shorelines, had an order to their chaotic structure.</p>

    <h3>The Mandelbrot set</h3>

    <p>The Mandelbrot set is one of the most famous examples of fractals in the mathematical world and it has the equation: zn+1 = zn^2 + c. The c and z variables of the equation consist of complex numbers and the n variable act as a positive integer. According to <a href="https://www.livescience.com/42966-complex-numbers.html" target="_blank">LiveScience</a>, complex numbers are numbers that consist of real numbers and imaginary numbers, which are numbers that equate to the square root of a negative number, these complex numbers are most notably described as a+bi, a being real numbers, and I being imaginary numbers. To cause this fractal to take shape, the equation uses iteration (a completely repetitive process. In order to learn more about this process you can look to <a href="https://plus.maths.org/content/what-mandelbrot-set" target="_blank">this webpage</a>, which goes more in-depth onto the function of this equation. However, to put it simply, we must plug in separate numbers and see the results that they project, if the input repeats exponentially, it will depict a certain color that is separate from the mandelbrot set, however, if there is a form of repetition in the output of these numbers, they will fall under our equation and start to form the Mandelbrot set. This equation's use of iteration and repetition, mixed with Mandelbrot's chaos theory causes for this set to be one of the most important fractals and geometrical discoveries of the known world.</p>

    <h3>Our Project</h3>

    <p>Now, what does our project have to do with Benoit Mandelbrot's famous geometrical discovery? Our project utilizes one of the largest subsects of fractal geometry called mandelbubs or 3D fractals. This form of fractal geometry was founded in 2009, as a group of researchers behind the fractal forums found a way to transfer the Mandelbrot set into a 3D shape according to <a href="http://www.mandelbulb.com/3d-fractal-art-mandelmorphs/" target="_blank">Mandelbulb.com</a> we created our form of these mandelbulbs for our make fair project and we created animations (below) to depict these mandelbulbs change shape as we tinkered with different variables for these mandelbulbs.</p>

        We created these different animations with the use of a 3D animation software that is called "blender". In the process of creating this, we had to take the aforementioned equation that was used to create the Mandelbrot set, and we put it into the blender software while tweaking the automated setting that created the number of bulbs in the 3D figure. Once we created these separate equations in the software, we reiterated the equation, constantly putting the previous result into the variables of the original equation to create a simulation of what it would look like to have a 3D Mandelbrot set. This isn't possible (to create a 3D Mandelbrot set) considering that it would require us to infinitely reiterate the structure, which we don't have the recourses to do. Therefore, we only reiterated 5 times and created the animations that we had. We then added color and other visual aspects to make the mandelbulbs look more refined and beautiful.
